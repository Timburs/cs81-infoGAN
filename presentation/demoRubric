Score: 10/10

1. Was a clear overview of the project given? Yes

Generative Adversarial Networks, co-evolutionary approach

Unsupervised, mutual info maximization

Provide minimal constraints on what should be learned (such as
categorical, continuous).

Gave a brief overview of the two loss functions being used.

2. Was the hypothesis and experiment to test it described? Yes

Facial recognition in unsupervised way, give it a categorical variable
for the number of different people in the data set

Animal recognition

InfoGAN will be able to come up with a reasonable discrimination of
individual faces (animal and human)

Hope to also apply this approach to artistic style

3. What aspect of the system was demonstrated?

CPU takes many hours per epoch, but on GPU takes 14 min per epoch
Need thousands of epochs to get good results

CelebA, George Bush data sets

Showed some results from runs on these data sets

Other data sets: YaleB11, Gerhard Schroeder (failed, but only 100
images)

Showed tensorboard visualization

Take away so far: Must specify lots of parameters and need lots of
data to succeed.

4. Were questions adequately answered? Yes

What parts of this are your own code? Answer to this question could
have been clearer. 

What advantages does this algorithm have? 

Why not start with animals (the easier task)?

Can you force it to pay attention to particular features?

Is there any way to know what each variable is representing?
